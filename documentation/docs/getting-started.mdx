# Bearer Auth React Context

(Now that's a mouthful.)

Bearer Auth React Context is a React Context meant to simplify integrations with APIs using Bearer Token Authorization.

Bearer Token Authentication a common authentication method. For details, see [RFC6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750), or various other online resources.

While handling bearer token itself is straightforward, it needs to be refreshed, and that's where things get icky.
I couldn't really find a sensible way of doing that in React (for example when using React-Query), hence this library.

Bearer Auth React Context provides React Context and associated hooks that:

- are network library (fetch, axios, etc.) agnostic
- automatically handle token refresh
- handles various edge cases (e.g.: if two requests fail at the same time, only one refresh request is sent)
- store Bearer auth token in `localStorage`
- provide convenient wrapper for network calls
- provide callbacks for when token refresh succeeds or fails
- plays nice with React-Query

## Getting Started

You need a working React project. Bootstrapped with Next.js, Create React App, manually, whatever your prefer - as long as it's React.

1. Install `bearer-auth-react-context` with your favourite package manager, e.g.:

```shell
yarn add bearer-auth-react-context
```

2. Wrap your app with `<BearerAuthContextProvider>`, e.g.:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  return (
    <BearerAuthContextProvider
      fetcherConfig={fetcherConfig}
      hasTokenExpired={hasTokenExpired}
      refreshHandler={handleTokenRefresh}
    >
      <MainPage />
    </BearerAuthContextProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

3. Provide required props:

- `fetcherConfig` - generic configuration object (typically including API URL) passed to each query function
- `hasTokenExpired` - function used to decide whether request failed because of expired token
- `refreshHandler` - function that performs actual token refresh

For more details, see [Handling Refresh](/handling-refresh).

4. Wrap all your API calls with `useBearerAuthWrapper()`. For more details, see [Making Network Calls](/network-calls).

5. You're good to go!
